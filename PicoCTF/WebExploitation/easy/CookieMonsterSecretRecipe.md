# Challenge Title
Cookie Monster Secret Recipe

## Description
This challenge involves locating a hidden piece of information—Cookie Monster’s secret recipe—embedded somewhere within a provided website. The prompt implies that the data is not immediately visible and may require inspecting web elements such as cookies, source code, or encoded content.

## Steps to Solve
1. Click the word `here` in the challenge description to open the website.
2. Use any random `Username` and `Password` to log in.
  - e.g: Username: `Cookie`, Password: `Monster`
3. Inspect the page.
  - Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect.
4. click the `Application` tab.
5. Click on `Cookies`.
6. Copy the cookie.

  ```
  - **Cookie value**: `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ%3D%3D`
  ```
  - The cookie is URL-encoded—%3D%3D is equivalent to ==. Most tools like CyberChef decode this automatically. After that, apply Base64 decoding.
    
7. Decode the cookie. 
  - To decode the cookie I used `CyberChef`
  - https://cyberchef.org/
  - Paste the copied `cookie` in the **input** tab.
  - Drag and drop the option `from Base64` from the left bar

## Notes
Base64 encoding is a way to represent any kind of data—text, images, files—as plain text using only letters, numbers, `+`, `/`, and `=`.

### Why use it?

Because many systems can’t handle raw binary data. Base64 converts that binary into a safe string format that can travel through text-based systems like URLs, emails, JSON, or HTML.

### Example:

- Original text: `Hello`
- Base64 encoded: `SGVsbG8=`

It’s not encryption. It doesn’t secure anything. It just makes binary data compatible with systems that expect text.
