## Notes
Base64 encoding is a way to take any kind of data—text, images, files—and turn it into a string made of only letters, numbers, +, /, and =.

**Why use it?**
Because not all systems handle raw binary data well. Base64 turns that data into plain text that can safely travel through places that expect only text—like URLs, emails, JSON, or HTML.

**Example:**
Original text: Hello
Base64 encoded: SGVsbG8=

It’s not encryption or hiding data—just repackaging it to make it easier to store or send. Anyone can decode it. Base64 isn’t for security, it's for compatibility.
