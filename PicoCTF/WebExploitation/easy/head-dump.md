## Notes

### API (Application Programming Interface) 
- An API is a set of rules that lets the client and server talk to each other.
- How it works:
	- The client sends a request to the server through the API.
	- The server processes that request and sends back a response using the same API.
- APIs are essential because they let different software systems communicate and share data without needing to know each other's internal code.
